# Simple Singleton

_A simple implementation of a singleton class in two flavours, ideal (and written for) Wordpress projects._

---

The contained class is a near copy of the example used at https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/php/example#example-1,
kudos to the author(s).

## Installation

```shell
> composer require gebruederheitz/simple-singleton
```

## Usage

Extend the abstract class or use the trait. Your class' constructor needs to be protected.


## Development

### Dependencies

- PHP >= 7.4
- [Composer 2.x](https://getcomposer.org)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and nodeJS LTS (v16.x)
- Nice to have: GNU Make (or drop-in alternative)
