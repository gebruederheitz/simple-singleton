# Simple Singleton

_A simple implementation of a singleton class in two flavours, ideal (and written for) Wordpress projects._

---

The contained class is a near copy of the example used at https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/php/example#example-1,
kudos to the author(s).

## Installation

```shell
> composer require gebruederheitz/simple-singleton
```

## Usage

Extend the abstract class or use the trait. Your class' constructor needs to be protected.
