# Simple Singleton

A simple implementation of a singleton class in two flavours, ideal (and written for) Wordpress projects.


## Installation

```shell
> composer require gebruederheitz/simple-singleton
```

## Usage

Extend the abstract class or use the trait. Your class' constructor needs to be protected or private.
